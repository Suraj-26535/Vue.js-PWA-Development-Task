Multi-Language PWA with Vue.js

This project is a multi-language Progressive Web Application (PWA) developed using Vue.js. It allows users to fill out a form with various types of fields. The form data structure is provided in the attached JSON file.

## Project setup

```
npm install

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```

npm run serve
Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the application.

This will start a development server, and you can access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8080 (or a different port if 8080 is in use).

Language Switching
The application supports multiple languages. You can switch between languages by clicking on language buttons on the main page. Add or remove language buttons as needed.

Form Submission
Fill out the form fields and click the "Submit" button to simulate form submission. The success message will be displayed as defined in the JSON data.

Styling and Layout
The form is designed to be aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. Styles are defined based on the JSON file.

Additional Notes

1. The JSON data structure is loaded dynamically into the form.
2. No backend integration is required for this task; form data is either displayed on the screen or stored locally.
3. For further customization, refer to the source code and make adjustments as needed.
4. Feel free to explore and modify the application to meet your specific requirements. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please check the documentation or create an issue in the repository.
